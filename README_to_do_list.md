Here's how the program works:

The program defines a ToDoList class that has methods to add, view, mark as complete, and delete tasks.
The add_task method adds a new task to the to-do list.
The view_tasks method displays all tasks in the to-do list along with their status.
The mark_as_complete method marks a task as complete.
The delete_task method deletes a task from the to-do list.
The main function provides a command-line interface to interact with the to-do list.
The program runs in an infinite loop until the user chooses to quit.
You can run this program and use the following commands to interact with the to-do list:

1: Add a new task
2: View all tasks
3: Mark a task as complete
4: Delete a task
5: Quit the program
