The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 using the random.randint function.
The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user for their guess.
If the user enters a number, the program checks if it's correct. If it is, the program congratulates the user and ends the game.
If the user's guess is incorrect, the program provides a hint by telling the user if their guess was too high or too low.
If the user enters something that's not a number, the program tells the user that it's not a valid number and asks for another guess.
If the user enters "quit", the program ends the game and reveals the correct number.
You can run this program and play the game by guessing the number!
